// this class is meant to be implemented as an abstraction layer between karney ff 
// functions and the user  since karney ff function dont directly depend upon points we defined but rather crude lat lon coordinates 
// it also doesn't have altitude definitions, so what i propose is that this file should use the karney ff functions and enhance them
// to conform to the requirements of the project.
